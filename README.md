- ‚ùì Who Am I
  - I am a person that can code poorly. Do not expect anything great from me & I try my best to be original as possible.
  - Also, I ain't nice, so don't be annoying. That'll make that show easily if you do that.
  - If I see a project being a hard task, I keep them private and don't even brag or mention about the project, unless they are apart of it, of course.
  - I sometimes give up on things, but you shouldn't! (it's a me issue)

- üèÜ Goals
  - I try to make everything that can be done easily free. I do not try to put any annoying paywalls behind it & such.
